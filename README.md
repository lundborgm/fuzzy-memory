## Code review

Daniel Thorsen

* Line 36 – Consider comment the timer function
* Line 101 - Consider comment the reset game function
* Line 108 - Consider commenting the function
* Line 130 - Look above
* Line 195 - (flippedCards = [];) Do you actually need to set this empty array?
* Line 178 - You can wrap your function around () and then add (); at the end to make the function run on load.  Then you don’t need to call it beneath.

Over all very-very nice! Love the timer with the tenth of a second function. Very cleaver!
